Folder Structure: Explain the folder structure of the project








Code Explanation: Break down the key parts of the code

api/…:

Index.js
- checks if a valid token is provided in the request cookies to check if user is authenticated.
- registers new user by saving their username and hashed password in the database
- checks user credentials and, if correct, generates and sends JWT token back to the user
- retrieves the logged-in user’s profile if they provide a valid token
- logs out user by clearing JWT token from the cookies
- allows authenticated users to create a post, including uploading a file.
- allows an authenticated user to update an existing post (only if they are the author).
- retrieves a list of posts, sorted by creation date.
- allows the author of a post to delete their post.

If successful, redirects to the homepage using <Navigate />.


EditPost.js (Currently identical to CreatePost.js)
Fetch existing posts by ID.
Pre-fill fields with current data.
Submit changes using PUT or PATCH request.


 IndexPage.js
Purpose: Homepage that lists all blog posts.
Key parts:
useEffect() fetches all posts from GET /post.
Stores posts in useState.
Maps each post to a <Post /> component.

Sends POST /login with credentials.
If successful, stores user info and redirects.

Key parts:
Uses useParams() to get post ID from URL.
Fetches post data from GET /post/:id.
Displays post content, image, and author.
If logged-in user is the author, shows an Edit button with link to /edit/:id.


RegisterPage.js
Purpose: Handles user registration.
Key parts:
Takes username and password.

Challenges Faced: Describe any difficulties encountered during the project and how they were resolved

A few package incompatibility issues, we had to downgrade some but that also resulted in corrupting the package.json so we had to reinstall the packages clean. The guy teaching in youtube named Dawid was hard to follow, he switched files all of a sudden and I can barely understand his accent which made it time consuming. The tutorial was like the guy was just talking to himself which annoyed us a lot. His stupid accent is what really made it worse. It was like listening to gibberish, I couldn’t understand a word without captions.
Tutorial did not include delete post function so we had to make our own
client folder not getting pushed so we had to force commit and push it. We have tried everything ChatGPT said but it just resulted in losing our files by using the –rebase.
Had trouble deploying, followed the instructions but the backend didn’t run, also debugged on it for about 5 hrs on my routes of connecting backend and frontend on deployments.


Future Improvements:
- Account system improvements
- Design improvements 
- Logic improvements so that code is cleaner and there are a lot more functionalities
- A page for moderators to manage posts
